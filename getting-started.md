# Getting started
****
Sprucebot again! ðŸŒ²ðŸ¤–

Building a skill is really easy.

There are only 4 steps you need before you get started.

1. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">latest Node</a>.
2. Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/">Yarn</a>.
3. Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code (vscode)</a>.
4. Setup vscode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">vscode to work through command line</a>.

Once Node, Yarn, and vscode are ready, follow these steps. ðŸ‘‡
<br />
<br />

```bash
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
spruce onboard
```
