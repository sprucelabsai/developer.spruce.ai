# Getting started

Sprucebot again! ðŸ‘‹

Building a skill is really easy.

There are only 5 steps you need to you get started:

1. Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">latest LTS Node</a>.
2. Install <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/">Yarn</a>.
3. Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code (vscode)</a>.
4. Setup vscode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line">vscode to work through command line</a>.
5. Quit vscode (**very important or vscode won't get new settings**)

Once Node, Yarn, and vscode are ready, choose your approach: ðŸ‘‡

## Option 1. Build your first skill
```bash
cd /path/to/development/folder
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
spruce onboard
```


## Option 2. Setup an existing skill
```bash
cd /path/to/existing/skill
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
spruce setup.vscode
```

## What's next?

It's time to familiarize yourself with the [Command Line Interface](/cli).
