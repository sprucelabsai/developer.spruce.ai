# Getting started
****
Sprucebot again! ğŸŒ²ğŸ¤–

Building a skill is really easy.

There are only 4 steps you need before you get started.

First is installing <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script">Node Version Manager</a>.

Second is installing <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/">Yarn</a>.

Then is installing <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>.

Last is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">setting up vscode to work through command line</a>.

Once NVM, Yarn, and vscode are installed, follow these steps. ğŸ‘‡
<br />
<br />

```bash
nvm install 12
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
spruce onboard
```
