# Getting started

Sprucebot again! ğŸŒ²ğŸ¤–

Building a skill is really easy.

There is 1 dependency you need before you get started, it's <a href="https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/">Yarn</a>.

Once Yarn is installed, follow these steps. ğŸ‘‡
<br />
<br />

```bash
yarn global add @sprucelabs/spruce-cli
spruce onboard
```
