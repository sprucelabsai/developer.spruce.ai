# Sprucebot Cache

There are often times you'll want to cache certain data coming back from your skill's API in order to increase
performance.

## Setting up the Cache

In your `.env` you'll need to set the following variables to use caching:

`CACHE_ENABLE=true`

`DEFAULT_TTL_SEC=300`

`REDIS_URL=redis://10.200.10.1:6379`

## Usage
