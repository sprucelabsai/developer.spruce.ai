# Spruce Skills Kit

Hey Skill Developer ðŸ‘‹.

# TLDR;

A Skill is a "micro-app". That is, a bit of functionality hyper focused on a single use-case. It consists of a `server` and an `interface`. Together, with `events` and `messages`, Skills can connect people in whole new ways.

# Sprucebot skills manifesto

Skills are programs with a purpose: [human-to-human connection](https://vimeo.com/204933933).

They accomplish this in one of two ways:

1. Automation - tech runs the show, people enable
2. Augmentation - people run the show, tech enables

## Automation

Lets say there is a lady named Becca. She nerds the f\*\*k out over fashion. So, she decided to open a menswear boutique. She loves it. But, do you know what she didn't expect? That she'd be spending all her time doing boring admin work. There are so many aspects of running a business that need to be automated, it literally warranted this document being created.

## Augmentation

Good augmentation is much harder to achieve than good automation. Automation comes natural. You think, "What processes can I get rid of?" Augmentation is the opposite. The question becomes, "What processes can I enhance?" When considering augmentation, it helps to think about the things a human brain can't do well (e.g. remembering names or personal details of 100 people a day) and what it can do well (e.g. solve complex social issues in real time).

## Making small business successful

This two pronged approach is the crux of our small business strategy. We want Becca to be able to focus on fashion, not all that other stuff. But, Becca's boutique needs more than good automation to succeed. She needs to be:

## Un-Amazon'able

Amazon rocks, doesn't it? Pretty much everything you need, basement prices, delivered right to your door. If Becca tried to compete with Amazon, she'd get smoked. She's gotta focus on the things that make brick-and-mortar unique. This means she needs to be building human-to-human relationships.

You've never logged into Amazon, had it say, "Welcome back \${firstName}" and thought to yourself, "Wow, that was nice!" But, when you walk into your favorite boutique, coffee shop, outdoor shop, barbershop, or salon and are welcomed by name, everything changes.

## Promote human-to-human connection

Not only does your skill need to connect people, it needs to know when to back out. Relationships, true relationships, are built without a middleman.
