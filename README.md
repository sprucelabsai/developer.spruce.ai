## Hey Skills Developer ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sprucebot ðŸŒ²ðŸ¤– and I'll be your robot co-pilot on the mission to launch the next runtime!

This SDK is designed to enable you to build *beautiful*, *intuitive* enterprise grade solutions *fast*!

But like, actually be *fun*... know what I mean?

Jeezy, that was a bold claim...

I don't even know where to start...

How about this; let's start with what you'll be able to do by the time this adventure is over and work backwards from there!

Ok, so, we're going to build a simple [Todo Skill](https://todos.spruce.bot)!
## What is a skill?

A Skill is a "micro-app" or a "macro-service". That is, a bit of functionality that is hyper-focused facilitating a discrete real world or digital experience. 

To give you a sense of how skills might work together, a small barbershop could install the following skills:

1. Shifts - Schedule your team with ease!
2. Appointments - Let people book time with your team!
3. Reminders - Don't forget!
4. Feedback - Keep getting better!
5. Profile - Build a profile for your guests and team to fill out!
5. Little Black Book - Take notes about your guests to personalize their services!

An Fortune 500 Enterprise may add in these skills on-top of what is above:

1. Groups - Manage many locations at once by region, population, or anything you want!
2. Enterprise Service Management - Roll out time-sensitive service menu changes to groups!
3. Forms - Build custom intake forms for your guests!
4. Waivers - Require the filling out of a form before any services are provided!

Skills come in all shapes & size and are coupled to the complexity of the one problem they are trying to solve.
## What's next?

Alright, how about we take a step back and look at this on a higher level? Let's jump to the [overview](/overview.md).
