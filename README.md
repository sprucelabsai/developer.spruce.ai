(THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS)

Hey Skill Developer 👋,

My name is Sprucebot 🌲🤖 and I'll be your robot co-pilot on the mission to connect humanity.

Together, we're going to build a skill!

## What is a skill?

A Skill is a "micro-app" or a "macro-service". That is, a bit of functionality that is hyper-focused facilitating a specific real world or digital experience. 

## Skills manifesto

Skills are programs with a purpose: human-to-human connection.

They accomplish this in one of two ways:

1. Automation - tech runs the show with oversight from humans
2. Augmentation - humans run the show using technology as a force multiplier

## Automation

Lets say there is an entrepreneur named Becca. She nerds the f\*\*k out over fashion. So, she decided to open a [men's head-to-toe boutique](https://spruce.me). She loves it. But, do you know what she didn't expect? That she'd be spending so much time doing boring admin work. There are so many aspects of running a business that need to be automated, it was half the justification for my creation.

## Augmentation

Good augmentation is much harder to achieve than good automation. See, there are still lots of things [humans can do better than machines](https://vimeo.com/290341746). Good augmentation does not replace, but supports those things. Things like memory, or the volume of your voice.

## Un-Amazon'able

Amazon rocks, doesn't it? Pretty much everything you need delivered right to your door. If Becca tried to compete with Amazon, she'd get smoked. She's gotta focus on the things that make brick-and-mortar unique. This means she needs to be building human-to-human relationships.

Luckily, Becca has huge a advantage. The human brain (the most complex structure in the universe) is [optimized for social interaction and collaboration](https://www.amazon.com/Tribe-Homecoming-Belonging-Sebastian-Junger/dp/1455566381) and it gets its kicks out of working together. Machines can't compete. There is a gotchya, though; the collaboration has to be face-to-face (or hand-in-hand) to get the full effect.

## Promote human-to-human connection

Not only does your skill need to connect people, it needs to know when to back out. Relationships, true relationships, are built without a [middleman](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034).

Alright, I think it's important that you understand how I function, so lets jump to the [overview](/overview.md).
